# cloud-lamp (WIP)

> The source code for my baby boy's IoT night light cloud lamp.

## Goals

* Controllable from any device on the same network via HTTP endpoints and a web
		interface.
* Integration with smart home systems including Amazon's Echo.
* Pseudo-random shifting color pattern(s) options for soothing the baby.
* Some kind of integration with music, white noise, or a microphone.
	* Maybe it starts playing rain sounds and softly glowing when the microphone
			is above a certain threshold?
